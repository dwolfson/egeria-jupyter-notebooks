    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Egeria is an open source project that provides open standards and implementation libraries to connect tools, catalogs and platforms together so they can share information about data and technology (called metadata).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab you will set up two types of governance server: an [Integration Daemon](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/integration-daemon/) and an [Engine Host](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/engine-host) that will work with a [Metadata Access Store](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/metadata-access-store/) to dynamically catalog metadata.  The aim is to show how these three types of [OMAG Servers](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/omag-server/) work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Egeria team use the personas and scenarios from the fictitious company called [Coco Pharmaceuticals](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/).\n",
    "As part of the huge business transformation that Coco Pharmaceuticals has embarked on, they\n",
    "have decided to use Egeria to manage their metadata across the enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: this Lab needs Egeria release 3.15 or later to run**\n",
