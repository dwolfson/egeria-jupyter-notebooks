# Open Metadata Labs

The open metadata labs contain an interactive environment that allow you to
experiment with different capabilities of Egeria.  As such we often refer to them as
**Hands-on Labs**.  They are implemented using the Jupyter Notebooks stored in this repository.

The labs can be set up and configured using the Docker Compose script in the **coco-lab-docker-compose** directory or can be 
deployed and configured manually. It is easiest to get started using the Docker Compose deployment; the README.md file in the 
directory provides more details.
