# Running the Egeria Labs

If you are viewing this file in a browser open to a Jupyter server that was set up to execute the Egeria Labs then you are in the right place!

To set up the Egeria Jupyter Lab environment please see the `README.md` file in the same directory.

If you are running Jupyter, on the left hand navigation panel you should see two folders:
* egeria-labs - contains the open metadata labs that allows you to explore features of Egeria in the context of Coco Pharmaceuticals.
* work - for your own notebooks.
* demos - jupyter notebooks demonstrating different Egeria capabilities.

To start working the labs, navigate to the `egeria-labs` folder and open the `read-me-first.ipynb` notebook.

For more information, please see [Open Metadata Labs](https://egeria-project.org/education/open-metadata-labs/overview)
